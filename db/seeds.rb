The clock struck nine.", "Now, I’ll tell you what, my friend, said Scrooge, I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.", " And will you have the goodness—here Scrooge whispered in his ear.", " Will you come and see me?", " He knows me, said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock.", " A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!", " I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy.", " Come back with the man, and I’ll give you a shilling.", " A quarter past.", " Nothing could be heartier.", " Come and see me.", " They are here—I am here—the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled.", " Not a farthing less.", "What’s to-day! cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.", " I don’t know what to say to such munifi—", " I thank you fifty times.", " It’s a pleasure to talk to him.", " And therefore, he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; and therefore I am about to raise your salary!", "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure.", " So did every one when they came.", "They are not torn down, cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, they are not torn down, rings and all.", "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don’t dance while you are at it.", "He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and said, Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe? It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.", "Yes, said Scrooge.", " Bless you!", "Hallo! returned the boy.", " Oh, glorious! Glorious!", " There’s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened.", "It’s Christmas Day! said Scrooge to himself.", " I don’t know anything.", " If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his heart upon.", " And will you have the goodness—here Scrooge whispered in his ear.", " And it was clear he meant to do it.", "If you please, said Scrooge.", " They are here—I am here—the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled.", " I have come to dinner.", " Of course they can.", "There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in! cried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace.", " The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!", " The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me.", " But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.", "Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, at the corner? Scrooge inquired.", "His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too.", " Why, Christmas Day.", " The bed was his own, the room was his own.", " Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!", " How do you do? I hope you succeeded yesterday.", "Where is he, my love? said Scrooge.", " I am behind my time.", "Is it? said Scrooge.", "Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, at the corner? Scrooge inquired.", "Hallo! returned the boy.", " And will you have the goodness—here Scrooge whispered in his ear.", "It’s only once a year, sir, pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank.", "He’s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress.", "His hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.", "Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head.", " What an honest expression it has in its face! It’s a wonderful knocker!—Here’s the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!", "Is your master at home, my dear? said Scrooge to the girl.", " His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.", "Why, it’s impossible to carry that to Camden Town, said Scrooge.", " They can do anything they like.", " He had never dreamed that any walk—that anything—could give him so much happiness.", " Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!", " He was at home in five minutes.", "An intelligent boy! said Scrooge.", "He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.", " I’m quite a baby.", "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure.", "His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too.", " The Spirits have done it all in one night.", " Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!", "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure.", " They can do anything they like.", " Nice girl! Very.", " Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!", " A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.", " I don’t know what to say to such munifi—", " I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy.", " I’ll go in here, my dear."]
